# Motion Blur Scrolling demo

![alt text](demo.gif 'Logo Title Text 1')

I've created this demo to see if it's possible to achieve more 'smooth' motion experience of
scrolling and any other movement on the page. Normally, even if your browser has consistant
60fps - frames are not 'blending' and it results in 'shaky' look.

There are many great videos showing this effect in detail, for example - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB21OGR8DSo

## Conclusion

Overall my conclusion is that while it might look great, usability of it is poor, especially
if you're scrolling looking for some content.

Enjoy!
